# On-the-Dynamical-Properties-of-Smooth-Closed-Surfaces
Under the Advice of Professor Renato Feres at Washington University, using knowledge from dynamical system to study the properties of smooth closed surfaces
My research is developed like this: By the derivative 's extended definition of the C1 tangential vector field on n-dimensional smooth manifolds , that is, the Lie derivative , combined with the properties of the single-parameter transformation group , the primitive Darboux median theorem is generalized to a class of functions with poor properties defined on n-dimensional smooth manifolds, and on the basis of this generalization. Since on compact manifolds , the C1 tangent vector field generates a single-parameter transformation group rather than a local one-parameter transformation group , which allows for some discussion of long-term dynamical behaviors, so I combine the generalized Darboux median theorem with some properties of smooth closed surfaces' dynamical theorems, like Poincare − Hopf Theorem,Poincare−Bendixson Theorem,Schwarz's Theorem, the properties of a class of continuous functions on smooth closed surfaces are obtained, while the obstruction for I obtain a higher dimension version of the below theorem 3 and theorem 4 is that, Differential dynamical systems are prone to chaos in three dimensions and above, and I don't actually know much about chaos, but I have seen a three-dimensional version of the Poincale-Bendixson theorem, but it seems that understanding the leaf-like structure is beyond the scope of my current knowledge:

Theorem 3: Let X be the C1 tangential vector field on S2, and there is only the only singularity Q,f : S2 → R is a continuous real function on S2 that is not a constant function, and ∀ P ∈ S2, f exist at P with respect to X's Lie derivative LXf(P), then the range of the function LXf is the interval with 0 as the internal point.

Theorem 4: Let M be a smooth closed surface, X is a C2 tangential vector field on M with at most one singularity, and X does not
Generate periodic tracks. f : M → R is a continuous real function on M that is not a constant function, and ∀ P ∈ M, f exist in the Lie derivative LXf(P) with respect to X at P, then the range of the function LXf is the interval with 0 as the internal point.
